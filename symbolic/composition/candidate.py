class Candidate():
    """# Candidate.
    
    A candidate composition discovered from experience data.
    
    This class tracks the statistical evidence for a potential new composite predicate. As the agent 
    gains experience, it collects evidence for and against various composition patterns. When enough 
    evidence accumulates and meets the statistical criteria, the candidate can be promoted to an 
    actual composite predicate.
    
    ## Evidence collection process:
        1. Observe predicate co-occurrences in successful episodes
        2. Track when the pattern holds vs when it doesn't
        3. Calculate confidence, support, and utility metrics
        4. Decide whether to create the new composite predicate
        
    ## Properties:
        * pattern               (Pattern):              The composition pattern this candidate 
                                                        represents.
        * definition            (Expression):           Formal logical definition of the 
                                                        composition.
        * evidence_count        (int):                  Total number of evidence instances observed.
        * positive_instances    (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Cases where the pattern held and was useful.
        * negative_instances    (List[Dict[str, Any]]): Cases where the pattern failed or was 
                                                        misleading.
        * co_occurrence         (float):                How often component predicates appear 
                                                        together.
        * distinctiveness       (float):                How unique/distinguishing this pattern is.
        * utility               (float):                How useful this composition is for achieving 
                                                        goals.
