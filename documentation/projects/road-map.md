## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Discovery Quality**: Implement multiple validation metrics and human evaluation
2. **Computational Complexity**: Profile early, optimize incrementally
3. **Learning Stability**: Extensive ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis

### Research Risks:
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Implement strong baselines early
2. **Reproducibility**: Version control, deterministic experiments, comprehensive documentation
3. **Evaluation Validity**: Multiple test environments and statistical rigor

### Timeline Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**: Focus on core contributions first, extensions later
2. **Implementation Delays**: Modular design allows parallel development
3. **Experimental Delays**: Start simple, scale complexity gradually

## Publication Strategy

### Target Conferences (by phase):
- **Phase 2 Complete**: ICML/NeurIPS Workshop (6-8 pages)
- **Phase 3 Complete**: ICML/NeurIPS Main Track (8-10 pages)
- **Phase 4 Complete**: Journal submission (25+ pages)

### Key Experimental Results Needed:
1. **Discovery Examples**: Clear visualizations of discovered predicates
2. **Performance Curves**: Sample efficiency improvements over time
3. **Transfer Results**: Performance maintenance across domains
4. **Ablation Studies**: Component contribution analysis
5. **Scalability Analysis**: Computational cost vs. environment complexity

### Novelty Claims:
1. **Automatic Hierarchical Discovery**: No hand-specified target patterns
2. **Neural-Statistical Fusion**: Combining complementary discovery methods
3. **Online Integration**: Discovery during RL training, not preprocessing
4. **Performance Validation**: Discovered predicates must improve learning
5. **Transfer Capability**: Hierarchies generalize across related domains
