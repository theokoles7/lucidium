# Conservative Advantage Regularization (CAR) - Project Tasks

## Project Overview
CAR introduces a variance-based penalty on the advantage function in the actor's loss to improve training stability and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. This regularization technique penalizes high variance across action-space advantage estimates.
