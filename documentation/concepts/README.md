# Reinforcement Learning Concepts

This directory contains conceptual documentation related to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its various paradigms. The documents explore foundational concepts, methodologies, and philosophical debates that shape the field of RL.

## Contents

* [Connectionism vs. Classicism in Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning](./connectionism_vs_classicism.md): A discussion on whether intelligent agents should rely on distributed neural networks or symbolic logic and rule-based systems for learning and reasoning.
* [Nativism vs. Empiricism in Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning](./nativism_vs_empericism.md): A discussion on whether intelligent agents should be born with innate symbolic structures or learn all representations through interaction with the environment.
* [On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Learning in Reinforcement Learning](./on-policy_vs_off-policy.md): An exploration of the differences between on-policy and off-policy learning paradigms in RL
