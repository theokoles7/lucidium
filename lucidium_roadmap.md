# Lucidium Development Roadmap & Context

## Project Overview
Lucidium is a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning framework focused on developing agents that can perform organic reasoning, inference, and logic. The system discovers and creates hierarchical composite predicates from experience data, enabling sophisticated symbolic reasoning capabilities.

## Core Architecture
- **Symbolic Layer**: Predicates, logical expressions, rules, and reasoning
- **Composition Engine**: Discovers patterns and creates composite predicates
- **Validation System**: Ensures logical coherence and prevents circular dependencies
- **Predicate Vocabulary**: Manages available predicate signatures

## Key Components Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Basic predicate system (Predicate, PredicateSet, PredicateVocabulary)
- Logical expressions (compound and predicate expressions)
- Composition patterns and candidate tracking
- Basic validation framework
- Core reasoning engine structure

### üöß In Progress
- Composition discovery algorithms
- Advanced validation logic
- Reasoning explanation system

### ‚ùå Not Started
- Unification algorithms
- Constraint propagation
- Neural network integration
- Training environments

## Development Priorities & Instructions

### PRIORITY 1: Core Composition Engine (Issues #15, #16, #17-21, #26, #33)

**Context**: The composition engine is the heart of the system. It needs sophisticated algorithms to discover meaningful patterns from experience data and validate them before creating new composite predicates.

**Current Issues to Address**:

   - Location: `symbolic/logic/rule.py`, method `_enumerate_bindings_()`
   - Current: Placeholder implementation
   - Need: Full constraint satisfaction algorithm with:
     - Arc consistency enforcement
     - Domain reduction through constraint propagation
     - Backtracking search with forward checking
     - Heuristic ordering (MRV, degree heuristic)

2. **Issue #16: Full Step Reasoning Explanation in `explain()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/logic/reason.py`, method `explain()`
   - Current: Simplified predicate existence check
   - Need: Complete reasoning trace showing:
     - Which rules were applied
     - Variable bindings used
     - Step-by-step derivation chain
     - Confidence propagation

3. **Issue #17: Redundancy Checking in `_is_redundant_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/composition/validation.py`
   - Current: Placeholder returning False
   - Need: Semantic similarity analysis to detect:
     - Functionally equivalent compositions
     - Subsumed patterns
     - Syntactically different but semantically identical definitions

4. **Issue #18: Theorem Proofs in `_is_logically_coherent_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/composition/validation.py`
   - Current: Basic contradiction pattern check
   - Need: Formal logical validation using:
     - SAT solving for consistency
     - Theorem proving for tautology detection
     - Model checking for correctness

5. **Issue #19: Dependency Graph Analysis in `_has_circular_dependency_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/composition/validation.py`

     - Build dependency graph from signatures
     - Detect cycles using DFS
     - Handle transitive dependencies

6. **Issue #20: Complexity Calculation in `_exceeds_complexity_limits_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/composition/validation.py`

     - Logical depth (nesting levels)
     - Variable count and interaction
     - Computational cost estimation

7. **Issue #21: Contradiction Detection in `_check_contradiction_patterns_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/composition/validation.py`

     - Direct contradictions (P ‚àß ¬¨P)
     - Indirect contradictions through inference
     - Type conflicts and impossible bindings

8. **Issue #26: Relevance Checking in `_composition_relevant_to_episode_()`**

     - Causal relationship detection
     - Temporal ordering validation
     - Goal-outcome correlation analysis

9. **Issue #33: Sophisticated Analysis in `_predicate_has_support_()`**
   - Location: `symbolic/logic/rule.py`

### PRIORITY 2: Logic Expression Enhancements (Issue #13)

**Issue #13: Distribution of OR Over AND in `distribute_or_over_and()`**
- Location: `symbolic/logic/expressions/compound.py`

  - Proper distribution: (A ‚à® (B ‚àß C)) ‚Üí ((A ‚à® B) ‚àß (A ‚à® C))
  - Recursive handling of nested expressions
  - Optimization to prevent exponential blowup

### PRIORITY 3: Unification Algorithm (Unlisted Issue)

**Location**: `symbolic/logic/rule.py`, method `enumerate_bindings()`
**Context**: Currently has sophisticated constraint propagation, but needs proper unification
**Need**: Classical unification algorithm with:
- Occurs check to prevent infinite structures
- Most general unifier computation
- Efficient variable substitution
- Integration with existing constraint system

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Issue:
1. **Understand the Context**: Read the existing code and comments to understand what's expected
2. **Research Algorithms**: These are classical AI/logic programming problems with well-established solutions
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Start with basic cases, add complexity gradually
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Create test cases covering edge cases and integration scenarios
5. **Document Decisions**: Explain algorithmic choices and trade-offs

### Code Style:
- Follow existing patterns (private methods with `_`, comprehensive docstrings)
- Use type hints consistently
- Add detailed comments explaining algorithmic steps
- Maintain error handling and validation

### Key Resources:
- "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (Russell & Norvig) - Chapters on logic, CSP, unification
- "Logic Programming" literature for unification algorithms
- "Handbook of Satisfiability" for SAT solving approaches
- Classical constraint satisfaction and theorem proving papers

## Testing Strategy

For each implementation:
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods with various inputs
2. **Integration Tests**: Test how components work together
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure algorithms scale reasonably
4. **Logical Correctness**: Verify outputs are logically sound

## Future Phases (Post-Priority Work)

### Phase 2: Neural Integration
- Connect symbolic reasoning with neural networks
- Implement learning from experience data
- Add confidence propagation mechanisms

### Phase 3: Environment Integration
- Create test environments for the system
- Implement experience collection and processing
- Add real-world reasoning scenarios

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Temporal reasoning extensions
- Probabilistic logic integration
- Meta-learning capabilities

## How to Continue Development

When resuming work on this project:

1. **Review Current State**: Check the latest TODO list and codebase
2. **Pick an Issue**: Start with Priority 1 issues, focusing on #15 or #16 as entry points
3. **Read Existing Code**: Understand the class structure and method signatures
4. **Implement Algorithm**: Use classical AI algorithms from literature
5. **Test and Validate**: Ensure correctness and integration
6. **Update Documentation**: Keep this roadmap current with progress

## Key Files to Focus On

- `symbolic/logic/rule.py` - Core unification and reasoning logic
- `symbolic/composition/validation.py` - Validation algorithms
- `symbolic/composition/candidate.py` - Pattern relevance analysis
- `symbolic/logic/expressions/compound.py` - Logic expression manipulation
- `symbolic/composition/engine.py` - Main composition discovery orchestration

This roadmap should be updated as development progresses. Each completed issue should be marked as ‚úÖ and any new discoveries or challenges should be documented.
