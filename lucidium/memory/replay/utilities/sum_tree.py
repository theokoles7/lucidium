    Internal data structure for Prioritized Experience Replay.

    A sum-tree is a complete binary tree stored in array form where:
    * Leaves:           (the last `capacity` nodes) store per-transition priorities p_i.
    * Internal nodes:   Store the sum of their children (for proportional sampling) and the min of 
                        their children (for computing normalization constants).

    This allows:
    * O(log N) updates:     When a leaf's priority changes, update ancestors.
    * O(log N) sampling:    Given a prefix-sum mass, descend the tree to find the corresponding index.
    
    ## Notes:
    * The tree capacity is padded to the next power-of-two for simplicity.
    * The API is intentionally minimal â€” sufficient for PER.
